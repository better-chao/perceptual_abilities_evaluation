## Abstract
The UDD (Urban Drone Dataset) is a benchmark dataset designed for semantic segmentation tasks in urban environments from a drone's perspective. This is a collection of drone image Dataset collected at Peking University, Huludao city, Henan University and Cangzhou city.It consists of high-resolution aerial images capturing diverse urban scenes, including roads, vehicles, pedestrians, buildings, and vegetation. The dataset is structured with six primary categories, making it suitable for research in autonomous driving, surveillance, and urban planning. UDD aims to provide a challenging setting for models to accurately segment small objects and complex urban layouts from an elevated viewpoint..
