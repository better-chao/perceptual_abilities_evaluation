# Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with Semantic-Assisted Calibration

<!-- [ALGORITHM] -->

## Abstract
SCAN is an open vocabulary semantic segmentation model. It believes that the gap between open vocabulary models and supervised methods lies in the in-vocabulary embedding and domain-biased CLIP prediction. Therefore, SCAN incorporate generalized semantic prior of CLIP into proposal embedding to avoid collapsing on known categories. Besides, a contextual shift strategy is applied to mitigate the
lack of global context and unnatural background noise.
